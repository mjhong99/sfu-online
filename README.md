Project Name: SFUO
02//26/2021, Version 1
                
Abstract        

In the event of school being taught online due to Covid-19, students are unable to socialize, form study channels, or make friends during these extremely stressful, overwhelming times. As online learning with little interactive sessions can be considered tough, SFU Online allows students to connect with other students, professors and teaching assistants. This web application brings the SFU community from campus to an online platform where users can easily communicate through features such as discussion boards and chat rooms.  

Customer 
The main customers of SFU Online are SFU students. In particular, new students who did not have the opportunity to meet other students due to Covid-19. SFU professors, Teaching Assistants, and tutors also have access to this website which will serve as a platform for them to easily communicate with students through chat rooms and discussion boards.  

    
Competitive Analysis 
There are existing products such as discord, slack, and canvas that are currently used as communication tools between university students. However, SFU Online differs from these products in that it is exclusively created for SFU, meaning that SFU students, professors, tutors, and teaching assistants all have access to this website. Unlike other social platforms used only between students, SFU Online can connect students with professors and TA’s as well. Additionally, as SFU Online’s main purpose is to allow users to easily communicate with one another, the application includes features that allow users to create channels and chatrooms which distinguishes SFU Online from canvas that lacks such features.
